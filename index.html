                    next user, which happens to be him, which forces him to make multiple trips down and move other people's laundry, wasting his precious time.

                    <strong>Problem: </strong>Fred is confused and intimidated by the lack of instructions and clear action flow conveyed by the washing machine. 
                    Having never done laundry before, he does not know how to navigate the numerous steps required to operate the machine.

                    that they've relied on their mothers for. After sitting and observing in the freshman-only Metcalf Hall for an hour, such students are not as rare as expected.
